## STM32 caputure images via OV2640 camera and send to host computer by ALK8266 WIFI module

>Prerequest: KEIL5, STM32 related packages are installed

1. This project code is used in buoy equipment, which could take images at regular intervals. The buoy device code is part of my bachelor thesis content.

2. In the host computer, we could send specific commands to control the frame and size of images.
